        <h6>SCOPE</h6>
        <p>I designed the first iteration of the mobile app and
            admin panel in 2018 alongside my friend and Founder of 
            the company Sophronia Mckenzie, who also doubles as a “passionate foodie”. 
            Not being able to see images of meals on the traditional restaurant menu was 
            the major pain point in her experience that birthed the concept of the visuEats app.

            Originally, the idea was to provide restaurants with a tablet that was preloaded with 
            the software would be created and provided by visuEats, but after thoughtful consideration 
            it was decided that a mobile app was a more feasible direction.

    <!-- PROBLEM / OVERVIEW-->
     <div class="container problem">
        <h6>THE PROBLEM</h6>
        <p>Restaurant diners have a hard time visualizing meals listed on
           traditional paper menus, this makes the decision process longer
           and creates a high chance of disappointment, as they are relying
           solely on imagination to visualize the meals.</p>
        <img>
        <h6>DESIGN OVERVIEW</h6>
        <img src="./images/Group 5.png">
        <h6>THE KICK OFF</h6>
        <p>In order to gain empathy within a short time frame, I decided to use
           Sophronia (Founder of visuEats) as the persona in the beginning phase 
           of this project. Her passion for food and love of a great dining out experience, 
           made her qualified for the role as the “ideal user”. 

            The train of thought here, was that if the app met her needs, it was good enough
            to launch.

            <h6>ANALYSING THE COMPETITORS</h6>
            <p>Mayber’s decision to provide the users with a search filter to find restaurants nearby
               was great for users who had no clue what to eat. The use of tiles as a design element as
               well as the decision to prioritize the images of meals gave users a clear view of what to
               expect in their order. This solution eases the frustration of people who currently order from 
               traditional menus.
               Yelp provided a visual guideline for us, as their use of cards to display meals and meal description
               is somewhat a standard in the industry so taking this approach would ensure that we created a design 
               that was familiar to our users.

        <p class="requirementsText">A list of requirements that was provided was used to design the first mid-fidelity prototype that was created for a tablet.  However, after quick consideration it was decided that providing both hardware and software was not feasible in the short timeframe.</p>
        <img class="requirementsImage" src="images/Rectangle 40.png">
        <p class="constraintText">Once it was identified that it was not going to be feasible to provide the hardware, the focus was quickly shifted to the creation of a mobile app. The app would allow users to access a restaurant’s menu from their mobile phones by downloading the app or scanning a QR code to access the menu.

            The first prototype allows users to view high-resolution images of the menu items as well as view the description and prices of items just like you would, using a traditional menu. Users can also select their language preference, filter the menu based on any food restrictions or diet, as well as leave and view restaurant ratings.
